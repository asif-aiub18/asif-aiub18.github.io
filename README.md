# VaccineReg-and-ManagementSystem
Description:

Every government in the world has taken some steps to counteract the Covid-19 outbreak. Bangladesh is not the opposite. Bangladesh, like other countries around the world, is being vaccinated to overcome Covid-19. Bangladesh's government has a new problem in distributing adequate vaccines due to the country's large population. Furthermore, the Bangladeshi government has proclaimed a national emergency across the country on multiple occasions. As a result, manually registering vaccines would be a huge problem. One of the best and smartest solutions to overcome this challenge is by using a proper vaccine registration web application. Users can use our website to obtain all other vaccines provided by the Government of Bangladesh, in addition to the covid-19 vaccine. Even if users frequently forget the time of their next vaccination, we will send an automated warning SMS/email to the user via our website so that the user can administer his/her scheduled vaccine on time and not miss his/her vaccination date. User need provide personal information including such their mobile number, NID number, name, age, and address in order to register for vaccines. This information will assist the government in appropriately distributing vaccination around the country.
